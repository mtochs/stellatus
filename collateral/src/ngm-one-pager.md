# **EOR Draft‑in‑48**
*Your TSF monthly report, ready in **≤48 hours** from existing data.*

**Software‑first. No new CapEx to start. Click‑through provenance your EOR will trust.**

## Why NGM should care
- **People‑heavy + backlogged**: ~**7 shifts** across Carlin, contractor backlog can delay drafts.
- **Outcome**: compress **capture → draft** to **≤48h** so leadership, EOR, and survey stay in sync.

## What you get
- **≤48h draft** after your **final survey drop** — figures, tables, captions in **your EOR's template**. *(48h measured from final survey drop → draft delivered)*
- **Provenance‑first**: click any figure to see **Source → QC → Transform → Figure**.
- **Three steps**: **Ingest & QC** (no reformatting) → **Change Cards** (top deltas + TARPs) → **Generate Draft** (Word/PDF + figures + CSV + provenance).

## Shadow Draft (post‑MNDA)
Send last month's bundle (piezos, GNSS/RTK, drone orthos/DSM/point cloud, bathy points) + last report/template.  
We return a **Shadow Draft in 7 days**. If it looks right, run a 30‑day pilot with a binary gate.

## 30‑day pilot (pass/fail)
- **Two ≤48h drafts** (from **final survey drop**)  
- **≥2 feeds** live (e.g., piezos + GNSS + survey drop)  
- **≤10 EOR edits** to finalize  
- **≥1 novel, actionable finding**  
*Miss the gate twice → pilot fee credited/refunded.*

## Deployment & data
- **Default after pilot:** **Stellatus‑managed private SaaS (ring‑fenced enclave)** for scale and rapid iteration.  
- **Pilot / policy exception:** run in **your cloud tenant**; expectation to **migrate to private SaaS** at subscription unless otherwise contracted.  
- **Read‑only collectors**; no control‑system access.  
- **Ownership:** you own raw & processed site data; we may license **de‑identified, derived features** (optional) to improve models across sites.

> **CTA:** **Share sample under MNDA → Shadow Draft in 7 days**

<small>*Illustrative pilots: **8–20 days → ≤48h** cycle time; **40–70%** internal hours reduction. Methods available on request.*</small>
