# Stellatus Project Rules and Important Information

## Critical Copy Guidelines (UPDATED 2025-09-30)

### Harmonized Metrics
- **ALWAYS use**: "8–20 days → ≤48h" for cycle time reduction
- **ALWAYS use**: "40–70% internal hours reduction"
- **NEVER use absolutes** like "95% reduction", "Zero backlog", "24/7 coverage"

### Architecture Positioning
- **Default deployment**: "Stellatus-managed private SaaS (ring-fenced enclave)"
- **Pilot/exception**: "Your cloud tenant; expectation to migrate to private SaaS at subscription unless otherwise contracted"
- **NEVER claim** SOC2/SOC 2 certification (we don't have it)
- **Read-only collectors** and "no control-system access" always

### 48h Clock Definition
- **ALWAYS specify**: "from final survey drop" or "48h measured from final survey drop → draft delivered"
- This clarification is critical for setting proper expectations

### Banned Phrases
- SOC2/SOC 2 (unless saying "SOC 2 program in progress" if true)
- "Zero backlog" → use "removes contractor backlog from critical path"
- "24/7 coverage" → use "continuous evaluation between cycles"
- "95% reduction" → use "40–70% reduction"
- "Air-Gapped (Q3)" → use "Air-gapped/on-prem: Available on request"
- Avoid disaster references (Brumadinho, Cadia, etc.)

## Logo Usage
- **ALWAYS use the official logo**: `/images/stellatus-logo-star-circuit.png`
- Never create CSS shapes or placeholders for the logo
- The logo should be used in all collateral, PDFs, and marketing materials

3. Commit with descriptive message
4. `git push origin master`
5. Deploy with `vercel --prod`

- Focus on photorealistic, professional enterprise aesthetics
- Avoid text overlays in generated images

## Decision-Support Positioning
